# ARIMA model on AMD stock prices from scratch
This predicts the price of AMD stock using past data and errors. It combines a differencing (I) with an autoregression (AR) and moving average model (MA), hence ARIMA. It outputs a prediction for all prices in the past and one for the 10 most recent days. The RSME is about 5% so it's pretty good, even if the graph doesn't look super accurate.
